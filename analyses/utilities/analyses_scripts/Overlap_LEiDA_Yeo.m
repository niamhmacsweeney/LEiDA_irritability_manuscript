function [cc_V_yeo,p_V_yeo] = Overlap_LEiDA_Yeo(parcellation,centroids,rangeK)
%
% Function to calculate overlap between LEiDA K-means results obtained in
% Glasser, DBS80, AAL116 or AAL120 parcellation with the 7 Resting State
% Networks from Yeo et al. 2011
%
% INPUT:
% parcellation  parcellation used to segment the brain ('AAL116' or
%               'AAL120' or 'glasser378' or 'dbs80')
% n_areas       number of areas of the parcellation to consider
% centroids     centroids obtained from applying K-means
% rangeK        range of clustering solutions considered for analysis
%
% OUTPUT:
% cc_V_yeo    correlation between Yeo nets and Centroids
% p_V_yeo      p-value of each correlation coefficient
%
%  Note that the Yeo parcellation does not cover some subcortical areas 
%  nor the cerebellum (so LEiDA results obtained including these strucutres 
%  it may make sence to compute the overlap removing these areas.
%  i.e. in AALl116 compare only the first 90
%  i.e. in AAL120 compare only the first 94 
%  i.e. in glasser378 compare only the first 360

% 1) Define the Yeo Networks in the new Parcellation
