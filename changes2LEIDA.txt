General Changes:

- ParcelsMNI2mm was saved in a format that has each parcellation scheme in a structure, e.g.:
AAL116.volume
AAL116.labels

This includes also the labels for Yeo7, whith the labels of Yeo7 also included here instead of within code, 
and the two extra networks removed from the volume (which was instead saved as Yeo9)

- introduce "run" script that has ALL parameters needed to run the analyses and calls the respective functions
instead of having mulitple scripts to run wherein the parameters need to be defined multiple times.

- in this run script extend a parcellation field to have 
	-name - defined based on possibleOptions to know which to load
	-areas - in terms of labelIDs
	-areas2remove - in terms of labelIDs
	-n_areas
	-YeoAtlas (with the aim of potentially using the 9 regions - not yet possible because colours are fixed to 7 in code) 

- because of the above transform LEiDA_AnalysisCentroid, LEiDA_AnalysisK, LEiDA_Start, LEiDA_StateTime and LEiDA_TransistionsK 
into functions that receive parameter structure with relevant parameters extracted from there 

- use "fullfile" instead of [] in all instances (did not change in Parcellate and Parcellate_ABIDE or subjstair) 
to avoid the need of thinking about putting  "/" at the end when defining paths and to make it compatible with Mac as well



LEiDA_Start
- only run part specific function if you haven't already before

Plot_K_3Dbrain & Plot_K_links_in_cortex & Plot_K_nodes_in_cortex & Plot_K_repertoire & Parcellate
- struct2array was not working for us so implemented workaround using load

cluster_stability
- loading of cluster data commented out because it is not used in the calculation of cluster stability

LEiDA_stats_FracOccup
-saved 'pair' in output as it was being called in another script loading the FaccOcc file

LEiDA_stats_TransitionMatrix
-TM_pval2sided saved as well because it is loaded on plot_k_diffs_transitions

Overlap_Yeo
- change parcellation call to parcellation.name when loading parcellation and n_areas by parcellation.n_areas.
- parcellation also includes field areas2remove. adapt the putting non interesting areas to zero within the script and calculate n_areas
based on number of unique labels (instead of assuming that lables are contiguous)
%[cc_V_yeo7, p_V_yeo7] = Overlap_LEiDA_Yeo(parcellation,n_areas,Kmeans_results,rangeK); % commented by JL
[cc_V_yeo7, p_V_yeo7] = Overlap_LEiDA_Yeo(parcellation,Kmeans_results,rangeK); % added by JL

Plot_Centroid_Pyramid
-remove the need to input n_areas (to make it consistent with other the other plot functions) and instead input "areas2remove". 
change this also in LEiDA_Start, where the function is being called, and within the function in the output to overlap_LEiDA_Yeo



Plot_C_boxplot_DT
Plot_C_boxplot_FO
Plot_C_summary
Plot_K_3Dbrain
Plot_K_boxplot_DT
Plot_K_boxplot_FO
Plot_K_overlap_yeo_nets
Plot_K_repertoire
Plot_K_V1_VoxelSpace
Plot_Centroid_Pyramid
- removed n_areas from within the script and as input to Overlap_LEiDA_Yeo

Plot_C_summary
Plot_C_vector_labelled
Plot_C_vector_ordered
Plot_K_vector_labelled
- changed way labels of parcellation are selected

Plot_C_summary
Plot_C_vector_labelled
Plot_C_vector_ordered
Plot_K_3Dbrain
Plot_K_links_in_cortex
Plot_K_nodes_in_cortex
Plot_K_repertoire
Plot_Centroid_Pyramid
- changed parcellation call to parcellation.name when loading parcellation


Plot_K_links_in_cortex, Plot_K_nodes_in_cortex
- changed MNI_coord definition to grab appropriate labels from parcellation assuming non-continugous/non-first n-labels

Plot_K_3Dbrain, Plot_K_repertoire, Plot_C_summary
- changed why region to plot is selected in order to account for non contiguous regions in atlas


Parcellate
- check if zipped or not automatically
- change input to be parcellation.name and parcellation.n_areas
