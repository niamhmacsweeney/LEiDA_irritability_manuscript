# LEiDA_irritability_manuscript
Repository for code used in MacSweeney et al. "Exploring dynamic functional brain networks in adolescent depression using a co-produced novel irritability paradigm".

##Folder structure and descriptions

###prep = scripts used to prepare behavioural data for use in analyses. 

###analyses = contains scripts adapted from LEiDA toolbox (https://github.com/PSYMARKER/leida-matlab#leida-analysis-k) by Joana Cabral (JC) and colleagues. These scripts were adapted by Joana Leitao (JL) in consultation with JC. The script "run_LEiDA_NM_template.script.m" should be run first and is used to set up the entire analysis pipeline. "run_LEiDA..." calls the other scripts within the analyses folder (e.g., LEiDA_Start_JL, LEiDA_AnalysisK_JL"). The utilities folder houses the scripts and functions called upon within the "run_LEiDA_NM_template.script". 

The "changes2LEIDA.txt" file documents changes made by JL to the original LEiDA toolbox scripts.
